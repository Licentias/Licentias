### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**Licentias/Licentias** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on this GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on software testing and web-development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning statistics
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m not looking to collaborate right now
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m not looking for help right now
- âš¡ Fun fact: Nothing really matters, anyone can see - Nothing really matters - Nothing really matters to me
